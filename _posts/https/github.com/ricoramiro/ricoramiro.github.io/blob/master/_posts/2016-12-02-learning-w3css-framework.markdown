# Learning New Framework from W3C

I decided to learn the new [W3.CSS framework](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) about a two weeks ago because it looks a lot easier to manage than Bootstrap.  I thoroughly enjoy working with Bootstrap, but it can get pretty redundant at times.

The W3School offers an extensive tutorial and plenty of examples so it doesn't take too long to get up to speed.  I can perform a lot of the tasks pretty fast, but I still have to look up some tasks because I haven't memorized the correct syntax.  It'll come to me.

## W3School's Website Blurb

W3.CSS is a [modern CSS framework](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) with built-in responsiveness:

    Smaller and faster than other CSS frameworks.

    Easier to learn, and easier to use than other CSS frameworks.

    Uses standard CSS only (No jQuery or JavaScript library).

    Speeds up and simplifies web development.

    Supports modern responsive design (mobile first) by default.

    Provides CSS equality for all browsers. Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari, and more.

    Provides CSS equality for all devices. PC, laptop, tablet, and mobile.

## Mobile Ready Out-of-the-Box

One of the main reasons I decided to learn W3.CSS is because at a basic level, there's no jQuery or JavaScript to worry about and it is a 'mobile first' framework so I don't have to worry about being mobile ready.  It's built-in :-).
