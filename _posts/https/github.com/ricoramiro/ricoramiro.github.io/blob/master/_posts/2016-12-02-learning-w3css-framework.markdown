# Learning New Framework from W3C

I decided to learn the new [http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/](W3.CSS framework) about a two weeks ago because it looks a lot easier to manage than Bootstrap.  I thoroghly enjoy working with Bootstrap, but it can get pretty redundant at times.

The W3School offers an extensive tutorial and plenty of examples so it doesn't take too long to get up to speed.  I can perform a lot of the tasks pretty fast, but I still have to look up some tasks because I haven't memorized the correct syntax.  It'll come to me.
