I just had to change my password for [ricoramiro.github.io](https://ricoramiro.github.io/ "ricoramiro.github.io") again!  That's about the third time this year that I've forgotten the password, not only for this platform, but for a few others as well.

I don't know if it is because I turned 51 years of age this year or if it is because I have other things to think about.  The one thing I do know is that it is a pain in the butt to have to change passwords.  Maybe this time I'll remember it.

Right after I write this blog post, I'm going to save the new password in a file along with all my other passwords because at least I'll have somewhere to look when I can't remember a password.

Other than that, I've been having a pretty productive day.  I had to reset my computer because, among other things, the speakers stopped working and it began acting funny.  I lost all the apps I installed so now I have a lot more work to do.  I don't mind that too much because now the speakers are working again so I can watch YouTube videos and listen to music.:+1:
