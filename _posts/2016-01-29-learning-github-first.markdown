title: Learning GitHub First
layout: post
---
I made a decision this week. I want to learn programming so I downloaded a lot of tutorials, mainly on Python because I figured I would learn that first.

Then I realized I should learn how to use GitHub first because that's going to be where I insert my code.  And it's the place I want to meet web developers.

In 1990 I learned programming on an Apple computer. But that was different code and it was a very long time ago. I have to start over and I am glad I have GitHub available as a resource.
