It is now 7:20 in the morning on a Tuesday.  I couldn't sleep so I've been up all night working on my computer.  One of the tasks I tried to complete was changing the template for this blog.

[Michale Rose,](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) another Github member, is offering a template called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) that looks pretty decent so I was excited about installing it, then using it.  I tried for a couple hours to change templates but I couldn't get the change to occur.  

# The problem may be that I don't know what I'm doing :-(

I am new to web development and I know only HTML 5 and CSS so far.  I'll get up to speed before next summer and maybe be proficient by the end of next year!  The important thing is I am working towards a goal of becoming a web developer.

Someone I know calls me a web dev wanna be and I just smile. I enjoy being creative and sharing with others and I'm glad to be a part of the Github community.
