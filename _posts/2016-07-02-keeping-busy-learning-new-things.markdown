#I've been busy lately learning new things

I have always kept my mind busy by reading or engaging in some activity that makes me use my brain.  Neuroscientists say that the brain is just like a muscle and that if we don't use it, it will atrophy then lead to Alzheimer's diseases or some other unpleasant illness.


Mental illness runs in my family so I have to be extra careful.  I learn something new every day!


Currently, I am learning how to create WordPress blogs and I think I'm doing pretty well.  I can make a simple WordPress site in a few minutes and even add plugins.  I'm thinking about purchasing another domain, but I haven't decided what I'll name the new site or what keywords I'll try to rank for.

Maybe I'll decide soon :-)
