# Ramiro on GithubWhen I launched this blog I had just gotten serious about learning to develop responsive websites and AMP pages.  I now know how to create WordPress blogs and static websites and I'm going to begin digging into the PHP of WordPress.  YIKES!It's a lot of work and, while I don't think I'll be as good as those with a formal education in web dev, I'll come close.  I'm not too far behind because I taught myself how to code in the early to mid eighties on an Apple where I created games and other applications.  I also learned HTML very early, so I'm familiar with the language and the changes.Coding was a lot of fun in the eighties and I've discovered it remains a rewarding way to pass the time.  It's *really awesome to be creative* and share that creativity with other webmasters/SEO content writers.  Although I mainly write about creating stuff, I also write about whatever is on my mind.  I have a blog called Trying to Change My Life that's helping me [change my life slowly](http://change-my-life.originalpressreleases.com/2016/06/still-changing-my-life-slowly-but-surely.html).   .  Usually I develop more than 50 drafts on a blogCurrently, I am studying web development.  After a lot of back and forth regarding what I should study first, I decided to study HTML 5 and CSS first, then PHP and the other languages.Please be sure to post a message with your blog's link so I can visit your site.
