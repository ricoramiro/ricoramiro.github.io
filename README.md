This is a blog I started on Github.  Please be sure to post a message with your blog's link so I can visit your site. 

I write about whatever is on my mind.  Currently, I am studying web development.  After a lot of back and forth regarding what I should study first, I decided to study HTML 5 and CSS first, then PHP and the other languages.
