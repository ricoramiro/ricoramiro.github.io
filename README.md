When I launched this blog a few months ago I had just gotten serious about learning to develop responsive websites.  I didn't know why I was doing it.  Creating HTML 5 websites was simply something I wanted to learn to do.  A few months later and I now know how to create WordPress blogs, Bootstrap and static websites, and I'm going to begin digging into the PHP of WordPress.  **YIKES!**

Web development is a lot of work and, while I don't think I'll be as good as those with a formal education in the field, I'll come close.  I'm not too far behind because I taught myself how to code in the early to mid eighties on an Apple home computer where I created games and other applications.  I also learned HTML very early, so I'm familiar with the language and the changes.

Writing programs was a lot of fun in the eighties and I've discovered it remains a rewarding way to pass the time.  It's **really awesome to be creative** and to share that creativity with other webmasters/SEO content writers.  

Although I mainly write about creating images and videos, I also write about whatever is on my mind the most in a particular week.  In fact, I have a blog called Trying to Change My Life that's helping me [change slowly](http://change-my-life.originalpressreleases.com/2016/06/still-changing-my-life-slowly-but-surely.html).  

I want to thank all the awesome people here on Github.  I can only aspire to be as giving and as dedicated as some of the people I've watched on this platform.  I'm glad I'm part of a great organization :-)
